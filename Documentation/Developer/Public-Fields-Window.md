### ‚ùì What does it do?

- **Lists all public fields** (variables) for any loaded script.
- **Interactively modify field values:** Change numbers, toggle booleans, or set strings on the fly.
- **Live debugging:** Instantly see the effect of changes in-game, perfect for tuning and troubleshooting your scripts!

### ‚ùì How can I access it?

- From **ConsoleUI**: Type in `publicfields` (or `pf`) and give it the name of the script you want to view the public fields of (e.g. `publicfields MyScript.ivsdk.dll`).
- From **ManagerUI**: Go to the `Scripts` tab, expand the header of the target script you want to view the public fields of, and check the `Show public field(s)` checkbox.

### üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª How to use it as a developer?

Variables of your script will automatically be shown in the Public Fields window when they are marked as `public`.  
You can control the behaviour of variables, and also modify the layout in the Public Fields window to make more appealing using [Attributes](IVSDKDotNet-Classes/Attributes.md). Follow the link to learn more about them.
