IV-SDK .NET is a .NET wrapper created by [ItsClonkAndre](https://github.com/ClonkAndre) for the original [IV-SDK](https://github.com/Zolika1351/iv-sdk) by [Zolika1351](https://github.com/Zolika1351).  
It allows you to create and run scripts for *Grand Theft Auto IV* using any .NET-supported language.

âš¡ Build powerful GTA IV mods with the full flexibility of .NET!

## Limitations
- Only works on GTA IV version 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0 yet 
- Not everything from IV-SDK was ported over to IV-SDK .NET yet. More things will be ported/added over time.

Feel free to contribute to this project to get rid of some limitations.  

## How to Install
